<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<h2>The Awful School</h2>
<p>This is a supermarket , I went to the top floor of it because of curiosity.<br/>
    But I was fooled by the USB , because I thought one of it was mine , and I just quit.<br/>
    When I go back to the supermarket , I found it was changed into school , so I take curiosity<br/>
    and go inside.I see many students were suffering because the teachers always fire them.<br/>
    So I help them to escape , I take one of the students , he is called by other people "card",<br/>
    another one was called GuoChen , when they go to the small hole that the school didn't fixed,<br/>
    but the teachers come here , so card just take a hammer and then blast on the teachers's head.<br/>
    I was very suprised because he can do this , then we need to rescue people from the "prison".<br/>
    but the hole was quickly fixed by the teachers , so we take other students from another door,<br/>
    and then I find my hammer , it looks like a pickaxe with a sharp head.</p>
